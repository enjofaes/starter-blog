**The year 2020 will always be in our memory. A positive thing some of us have done is learn a new skill and develop more knowledge. This hunger for learning more will be necessary to make a difference and differentiate yourself from others. Skills like _coding_, _marketing_, and _language_ are important! The world will ever be more data driven. So do not get behind. **
