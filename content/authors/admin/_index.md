Enjo Faes is a motivated and ambitious student, currently fininshed his master of Applied Economic Sciences at the university of Antwerp (with Major: Finance & Minor: Data science). Because of his ambition and attitude to learn a lot more he has considered to follow an extra master: a year at Antwerp Management School: Master in Finance.

He is very interested in risk management, corporate finance and the industry playing field as a whole. He wrote his Bachelor thesis about "Corporate Venturing" & masterthesis in corporate finance about "Entrepreneurship, Financial development and Economic Growth, a multivariate time series analysis for Belgium", which was very broad but interesting econometric analysis.

Right now fully developing his skills on R programming every week on Datacamp. Following two tracks at Capitant (IB/PE track and Asset management track) and fully pursuing a great year at AMS.
